If you want to restrict your EC2 instance from connecting directly to the internet but still enable it to communicate with GitHub's services securely, you can set up a network architecture that routes traffic through a private subnet and optionally uses a proxy or a transit gateway for outbound connectivity. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Network Architecture:

1. **Private Subnet**:
   - Deploy your EC2 instance in a private subnet within your VPC.
   - Ensure that the private subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway.

2. **NAT Gateway or NAT Instance (Optional)**:
   - If your EC2 instance needs outbound internet access for communicating with GitHub's services, you can deploy a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in a public subnet.
   - Configure the private subnet's route table to route all internet-bound traffic through the NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.
   - Ensure that the security groups associated with the NAT Gateway or NAT Instance allow outbound traffic to GitHub's services (e.g., api.github.com over HTTPS).

3. **Proxy Server (Optional)**:
   - Deploy a proxy server within your network infrastructure or in a separate subnet.
   - Configure the EC2 instance to route outbound traffic through the proxy server.
   - Ensure that the proxy server allows outbound traffic to GitHub's services and is properly configured to handle HTTPS traffic.

4. **Transit Gateway (Optional)**:
   - If you have multiple VPCs or on-premises networks that need access to GitHub's services, consider using AWS Transit Gateway.
   - Deploy the EC2 instance and GitHub's services (if applicable) in separate VPCs.
   - Attach both VPCs to the Transit Gateway.
   - Configure route propagation and route tables to allow traffic between the VPCs through the Transit Gateway.
   - Ensure that the Transit Gateway allows outbound traffic to GitHub's services.

### Security Considerations:

1. **Security Groups**:
   - Configure security groups for the EC2 instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Allow inbound SSH (if needed) and outbound traffic to the proxy server or NAT Gateway/NAT Instance.
   - Restrict outbound traffic to only necessary destinations, such as GitHub's services.

2. **IAM Policies**:
   - Ensure that the IAM role associated with the EC2 instance has the necessary permissions to communicate with GitHub's services and other AWS resources.

### GitHub Runner Configuration:

1. **Proxy Configuration**:
   - If using a proxy server, configure the EC2 instance to use the proxy for outbound traffic.
   - Set environment variables or update system-wide proxy settings as needed.

2. **Outbound Connectivity**:
   - Test the connectivity from the EC2 instance to GitHub's services to ensure that it can register as a self-hosted runner and communicate with GitHub repositories.

By implementing these network architecture and security measures, you can ensure that your EC2 instance can communicate securely with GitHub's services without direct internet access, providing an additional layer of isolation and security for your environment.
