Key Insights:
1.Automated Billing Forecast: Using AWS API in our POC account, I implemented a solution that automates the retrieval of billing details and forecast information.
2.Interactive HTML Dashboard: The billing details and forecast are displayed in an interactive HTML page, making it easier for stakeholders to monitor and understand the cost trends.
3.Serverless Implementation: The entire solution leverages AWS Lambda functions written in Python, ensuring a scalable and cost-effective way to gather and present the billing data without the need for dedicated infrastructure.
