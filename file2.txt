Backup Job in us-east-1:

This job copies all resources, including application code from Bitbucket, to an S3 bucket in the us-east-1 region.
This has been happening for the past two years.
Copy Job from us-east-1 to us-west-2:

There is a separate job configured in us-east-1 that copies the contents of the same S3 bucket to another S3 bucket in the us-west-2 region.
Backup Job in us-west-2:

Additionally, there's another backup job running in the us-west-2 region that backs up the same S3 bucket located in us-west-2.
Essentially, you have a chain of backup jobs and copy operations involving the same data across multiple regions:

Backup in us-east-1 → S3 bucket in us-east-1.
Copy from us-east-1 → S3 bucket in us-west-2.
Another backup job in us-west-2 on the S3 bucket in us-west-2.
