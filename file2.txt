General Migration Steps

Assuming you're migrating Nexus Repository Manager 3 to a recent OpenShift version and require data migration and high availability:

1. Backup Your On-Prem Nexus
Database Backup: If using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL), create a complete backup.
Blob Store Backup: Back up the blob store containing artifacts.
Configuration Backup: Backup Nexus configuration files.
2. Prepare OpenShift Environment
Create Project: Create a dedicated project for Nexus.
Persistent Storage: Set up persistent volumes and storage classes for Nexus data and configuration.
Image Registry: Ensure you have an accessible image registry for Nexus Docker images.
3. Install Nexus Operator
Operator Hub: Use the OpenShift Operator Hub to install the Nexus Repository HA Operator.
Custom Resource Definition (CRD): Create a NexusRepo custom resource to define your Nexus instance.
4. Deploy Nexus
Operator-Managed Deployment: Use the Nexus Repository HA Operator to deploy Nexus instances.
High Availability: Configure the operator for high availability if required.
Environment Variables: Set environment variables for database connection, blob store, and other configurations.
5. Data Migration
Database Migration: Restore the database backup to the OpenShift database.
Blob Store Migration: Copy blob store data to the configured persistent volume.
Configuration Migration: Apply the backed-up configuration to the Nexus instance.
6. Testing and Validation
Functionality Testing: Verify Nexus services and repositories are working correctly.
Performance Testing: Evaluate Nexus performance under load.
Data Integrity: Check data consistency after migration.
7. Cutover and Finalization
DNS Updates: Update DNS records to point to the new OpenShift Nexus instance.
Client Configuration: Update client configurations to use the new Nexus endpoint.
Monitor and Optimize: Continuously monitor Nexus performance and optimize as needed.
Additional Considerations

Nexus Version Compatibility: Ensure compatibility between your on-prem Nexus version and the Nexus operator.
Database Migration Tools: Consider using database migration tools for efficient data transfer.
Security: Implement appropriate security measures for Nexus on OpenShift.
Backup and Disaster Recovery: Establish backup and disaster recovery procedures for the OpenShift Nexus environment.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring for Nexus components and metrics.
