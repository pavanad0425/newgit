Ah, got it! Sysdig is a powerful system monitoring and troubleshooting tool. Here's how you can install Sysdig on Red Hat UBI 8:

1. **Add Sysdig Repository**: First, you need to add the Sysdig repository to your system. You can do this by creating a new repository file in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory. For example, you can create a file named `sysdig.repo`:

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/sysdig.repo
    ```

    Then, add the following lines to the file:

    ```plaintext
    [sysdig]
    name=Sysdig Stable - $basearch
    baseurl=https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/rpm/$basearch
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/DRAIOS-GPG-KEY.public
    enabled=1
    ```

    Save and exit the text editor.

2. **Install Sysdig**: Once you've added the repository, you can install Sysdig using yum:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y sysdig
    ```

    This command will install Sysdig along with any necessary dependencies.

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, you can verify that Sysdig is installed correctly by running:

    ```bash
    sysdig --version
    ```

    This command should output the installed version of Sysdig, indicating that it's installed properly.

That's it! Sysdig should now be installed on your Red Hat UBI 8 system. You can start using it to monitor and troubleshoot your system as needed.
